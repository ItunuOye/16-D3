          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Poverty has long been recognized as a contributor to death 
            and disease, but several recent trends have generated an 
            increased focus on the link between income and health. 
            First, income inequality in the United States has increased 
            dramatically in recent decades, while health indicators have 
            plateaued, and life expectancy differences by income have grown. 
            Second, there is growing scholarly and public recognition 
            that many nonclinical factors—education, employment, race, 
            ethnicity, and geography—influence health outcomes. Third, 
            health care payment and delivery system reforms have 
            encouraged an emphasis on addressing social determinants of 
            health, including income.</p>
            <p>In this brief, we review the evidence supporting the income-health relationship 
              and the likely mechanisms through which income affects health. We then 
              discuss the growing importance of this association, given widening income 
              inequality, and discuss policy levers that might help reduce income-related 
              health disparities.</p>
